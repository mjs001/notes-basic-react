# notes-basic-react
Basic notes app made with React, CSS, JS, PostgreSQL, Node, and Express.

The backend is hosted on Render which spins down the server after a few minutes of inactivity. Due to this, you must click on the backend link first to "wake it up" and then you can click on the frontend link. I will be migrating this code to another deployment service shortly so that this won't be a problem anymore.
